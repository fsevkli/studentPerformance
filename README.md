# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview

This is a machine learning learning project aimed at predicting student performance based on open data. The goal is to utilize machine learning algorithms to estimate exam scores using various parameters provided for each student.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:** Open data related to student performance will be gathered for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing the data for effective machine learning model training.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
- **Model Training:** Training the selected models on the preprocessed data.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using relevant metrics.
- **Prediction:** Using the trained models to predict student exam scores.
